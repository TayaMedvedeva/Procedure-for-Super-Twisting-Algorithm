# Step-test-based procedure for Super-Twisting Algorithm gains adjustment

The proposed procedure consists of four steps:
1) Identification of the open-loop model via the original Ziegler-Nichols step-test.
2) Prediction of chattering parameters (frequency and amplitude) using the DF approach and HB analysis.
3) Orbital stability verification of the closed-loop system with predicted chattering parameters using Loeb's criterion.
4) Final choice of STA gains minimizing the amplitude of main harmonics as function of the closed-loop parameters.
